On his deceased wife 


On his deceased wife 

Me thought I saw my late espoused 
Saint Brought to me like Alcestis,2 from the grave,  
Whom Jove's great son3 to her glad husband4 gave,  
Rescued from death by force, though pale and faint.
Mine, as whom wash'd from spot of child-bed taint  
Purification in the old Law did save, . And  such, as yet once more I trust to have  
Full sight of her in Heaven without restraint,
Came vested all in white, pure as her mind:
Her face was vail'd;  yet to my fancied sight  
Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined
So clear, as in no face with more delight.  
But O, as to embrace me she inclined, I waked; she fled; and day brought back my night.
